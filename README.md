# Project-1
## Study of the effect of migration on housing costs

# Introduction
    The effects of migration are often talked about and debated both good and bad.  This is a short
study to see if there is any effect on the price of houses in areas where migration rates are different
from the average.

# Methodology

    We will use census data from 2010 to 2019 along with data from Zillow over the same period to look
for a relationship between migration data and house prices in that time period.  We are using that
time period since it mostly misses the recession.  We will use the US as a whole for the control.
The data will be processed in two Jupyter Notebooks, one for data cleaning and the other for analysis.
